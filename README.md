## Helping decisions in a complex world

Ordel will not make simple decisions for you in a complex world. Only human beings are able to do that and it takes much more than algorithms to make good ones. But hopefully Ordel can help instruct part of your decisions: the ones that partly rely on a bit of tidiness and order.

When everything is a mess, a good place to start to figure things out is to try and sort them. This wonâ€™t be enough but itâ€™s a start. What Ordel gives you is a tool to do that on your own or collectively if you want to add some collective intelligence to the process.

## Democracy to order, your final cut to decide

Ordel is also a good tool to support democracy because it offers different kinds of ballots and sorting algorithms. Read more in the Frequently Asked Questions about Ordel.

## We are Ordel

### Karine

Her smartphone apps are sorted by color, her books by size and author. She devotes much of her work to defining, sorting and connecting things (the lost art of taxonomy).

She had that crazy Ordel idea and is responsible for what is not code in the product.

### Anthony

Every single line of code in Ordel is his and has been crafted with love (and Svelte), to keep it simple and fast.

As he describes himself as "a bit" rigorous, it was only natural for Anthony to participate in this beautiful enterprise of tidying up the world a bit.
